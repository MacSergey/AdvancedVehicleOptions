# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.8
* New - Stand Size selection for passenger planes. All passenger planes can now be re-configured to use Small/Medium/Large stands. Be patient, it will take several minutes until the change is applied, as the setting will be active only for new spawned planes. Existing planes in transit will use the already calculated travel path and will ignore the change. At one point in time re-configured planes will dock to the selected stands. Non Airport-DLC users will not see this option. The selection can be reverted anytime to Default value, settings will be stored in the vehicle config.xml and savegame.
* New - Engine/Trailer synchronization for trains. Trains and theirs trailers can now be synchronized when data options are changed on the engine. Data values supported: Speed, Acceleration, Braking, Turning, Springs, Dampers, Lean and Nod. Choose in Mod Options, if AVO shall remember the setting or if it is one-time change only. Engine/trailer sync is done, as long the checkbox in the mainwindow is ticked.
* Change - New logic to sort trucks/busses/service vehicles and their trailers. C:S has not supported bus trailers upto Airport-DLC. Asset Creators used truck trailer templates, with result that AVO sorts e.g. a bus vehicle to the "Bus" section and the bus trailer to "Industrial Farming" - as the bus trailer template was a "farming trailer". To overcome AVO had a comprehenive list in the past checking SteamIDs. This list is removed and AVO now sorts the trailer depending on the engine classification (eg. Public transport Bus or Fire Service). This will make all vehicle trailers sort 100% correct along with the engine vehicle. Works for all road vehicles.

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.3

Vehicle Configuration:
* New - Button for Reset full configuration / all customized settings.
* Enhanced - Export now reports back, where the configuration file is located.
* Fixed - Savegames created with older versions of AVO will no longer fail with error message when loading the vehicle configuration

Vehicle Settings
* Changed - Section for Configuration now called "Actions for Vehicle Configuration".
* Changed - Section "Remove Vehicles" now called "Actions For + Vehicle Type".
* Changed - "Restore Default" is now "Default Values" for a vehicle type. Moved down to Remove Driving & Parked section.
* Changed - Capacity description label will be adapted to what kind of vehicle it is, eg. Public transport will show Passenger while Industry shows Cargo and Postal Service reflects Mail.
* New - Option for display speed units Miles per Hour or Kilometer per Hour.
* Fixed - Full support for Fishing Industry.
* Enhanced - Support for enhanced vehicle properties (eg. pumping rate, travel distance, criminal rate, fishing rate and more).
* Changed - AVO will no longer allow to disable "Bus trailers" from the trailer itself. Reason for that is that the bus trailer is a re-assigned industrial vehicle. However, disabling the main vehicle will disable also the trailer.

Vehicle Locator & Remover
* Enhanced - When pressing SHIFT on the location tag, AVO will directly zoom to the next available vehicle. If SHIFT is not pressed, it will only center to the next available vehicle.
* New - Remove the previously located vehicle.

Mod Compatibility
* Change - AVO will no longer block setting changes, if Improved Public Transport or Transport Lines Manager are present. Instead it will color shared fields in red to warn the user, that this may result in compatibility issues.
* Change - Settings for warnings (triggered by Improved Public Transport and Transport Lines Manager) activate/deactivate the red color coding in shared data fields.
* Removed - Checkbox Options for Improved Public Transport and Transport Lines Manager have been removed.

Vehicle Spawning
* New - Button for accessing directly the Cities Skylines Transport Line Overview panel instead informing the user that "Spawning is controlled by Cities Skylines, IPT or TLM". User can now directly open the Line Overview and change the desired vehicle.
* New - Small help button sending the user to a new section for Spawning Explanation.

Mod Option Panel
* Changed - Compatibility settings in the Mod Option Panel will be only displayed, if the related mod is installed and active (Vehicle Color Extender, IsBigVehicle).

Experimental Mod Support
* New - Mod support NoBigTruck created by MacSergey using the "IsLargeVehicle" flag. You need the mod NoBigTruck installed to make this work. If a vehicle is flagged as "Large Vehicle" the IsBigTruck mod should not send this vehicle to small buildings. Please contact MacSergey for any issues, AVO only sets the flag. Subscribe to the NoBigTruck mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2069057130).

Trailer Reference List

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions

This version is 1.8.7, incorporating airatin's updates and additional changes intended to make this mod compatible with More Vechicles by @dymanoid, most importantly using ```Array16<T>::m_buffer.Length``` instead of ```Array16<T>::m_size``` to iterate over the filled length of ```VehicleManager.instance.m_vehicles``` and ```VehicleManager.instance.m_parkedVehicles``` to circumvent the use of preset vehicle limits.

# Testing

I've seen a normal frequency of functional cargo trains in multiple cities of different sizes while using this version locally with More Vehicles and many other mods (to be updated), but please test further before incorporating into the workshop version.
